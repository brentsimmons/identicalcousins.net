We talk about Brent’s first three weeks of indie life. Spoiler: he’s enjoying it.

Then, because Michael has a cold, we lose our senses entirely and talk for a while about the Mailbox queue. Brilliant marketing? Pure evil? Making lemons out of lemonade? A nice user experience? A mix of all the above?

Also: cousin Michael gives us a sneak peek at Fantastical 1.1. But his cold makes him misspeak: he says the app uses the word “pasteboard” but in reality it uses the word “clipboard.”

This episode is sponsored by <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a>. Mobile Services is a new component of Azure — a very high-level component that makes creating web services for mobile apps (database storage, user authentication, push notifications, email, and so on) easy. (Really easy. Startlingly simple.)

Some things we mention:

<ul><li><a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/">Mailbox</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flexibits.com/">Fantastical</a></li>
</ul>

Okay, that’s just about it.

Brent’s audio is a bit noisy. He’s working on it. (He has a Blue Yeti. Good mic. The problem isn’t the mic.)

Also: we used a curse word somewhere in the podcast. The f-word. So we marked this episode as explicit for iTunes.
