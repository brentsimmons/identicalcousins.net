Recorded 7 Dec. 2012. We talk about the launch of <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone">Fantastical for iPhone</a> — a little bit about marketing, but mainly about app design.

You can <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/identicalcousins/identicalcousins7.m4a">download the m4a file</a>.

Warning about sound quality: Brent’s microphone goes weird around 19:00 and he switches to another microphone. We apologize for the less-than-smooth experience. (That microphone has been given a stern talking-to and placed in the time-out corner while it thinks about its bad self.)
